 * @property {float} s 1D texture coordinates.
 * @property {vec2} st 2D texture coordinates.
 * @property {vec3} str 3D texture coordinates.
 * @property {vec3} normalEC Unperturbed surface normal in eye coordinates.
 * @property {mat3} tangentToEyeMatrix Matrix for converting a tangent space normal to eye space.
 * @property {vec3} positionToEyeEC Vector from the fragment to the eye in eye coordinates.  The magnitude is the distance in meters from the fragment to the eye.
 * @property {float} height The height of the terrain in meters above or below the WGS84 ellipsoid.  Only available for globe materials.
 * @property {float} slope The slope of the terrain normalized from 0 to 1.  0 is completely vertical, 1 is completely flat.  Only available for globe materials.
